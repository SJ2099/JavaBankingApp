Introduction -

Net Banking has become a necessity as it provides a convinient and efficent way for all the customers to perfrom transactions like deposit, withdraw and transfer money anywhere and anytime. As many of the operations are automated, the manual labour is reduced, also the chances of error are negligible as they will only work as programmed. 
But along with these advantages come concerns for security of data and assets of the customer so it is necessary to maintain security features and test each module.

Modules of the banking management system are -

1.Bank Branch- Every bank has multiple branches in many cities in different countries. Each branch has its unique branch id.

2.Profile- This module will contain personal information of the customer like name, age, gender, address etc.

3.Account- Every customer becomes a customer after opening bank account. There are different types of account like- savings, current, checking. Each account has its unique account number, type and bank branch.

4.Transaction- Customers perform transactions like deposit, withdraw and tranfer using their bank accounts. Everytime any customer performs transactions, it will be reflected in the bank database.
